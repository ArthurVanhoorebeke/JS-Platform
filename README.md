# JS-Platform
This is a lil js platformer game
It runs pretty OK, but I feel like performance is still pretty shitty.
I don't plan on working on this anymore.

## I'm completely new to git(hub)
So I don't fully know what i'm doing, sorry

## If you feel like improving this
Feel free to do so and tell me about it
